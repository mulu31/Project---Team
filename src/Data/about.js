        "Project Team is a newly launched initiative under the Hucisa Club at Haramaya University, founded in December 2024. Operating from Building 2, Room 10 on the Main Campus, we're starting from ground zero to create a bridge between Haramaya's talented students and real-world opportunities. Our dual mission focuses on connecting technically skilled students with employment through local company partnerships and UpWork freelancing, while running intensive skill-building programs for passionate beginners with no prior experience.",
        "As a startup initiative, we're building everything from scratch: establishing our first company partnerships with Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa businesses, creating structured training curricula for complete beginners, and setting up systems for project collaboration. Unlike established clubs, we're documenting our journey from zero to impact, creating a model that other Ethiopian universities can replicate. Our current focus is building foundational systems and onboarding our first cohort of 30 pioneer members who will shape our culture and processes.",
        "Our vision is to become the premier talent pipeline from Haramaya University to Ethiopia's growing tech ecosystem. We're starting small but thinking big—documenting every success and failure, creating sustainable systems, and building genuine relationships with local tech companies. In our first year, success means helping our first 5 students secure freelance work, training 20 beginners to technical proficiency, and establishing 3 solid company partnerships in the region.",
